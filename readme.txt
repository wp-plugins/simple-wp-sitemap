An easy, fast and secure plugin that adds both an xml and an html sitemap to your site, which updates and maintains themselves so you dont have to!

== Description ==

Simple Wp Sitemap is a plugin that serves both an xml and an html sitemap to your page as static files. These are updated automatically everytime a post or page is created, edited or deleted, and makes sure they're easily indexed. What this means you only have to install and activate the plugin once, and it will just work for you without you ever having to worry.

Reason the sitemaps are created as static files and aren't generated everytime someone's visiting them, is because of the awesome performance that comes with not having to do database queries and php rendering all day. Sure you have to wait a couple milliseconds extra when you create a new or edit a post, but in my opinion that's totally worth it!

Also supports the option to add pages to the sitemaps that aren't part of your original wordpress site. For instance if you create a little html file and upload to your server and want it to be included in the sitemaps, it's easily done. You can also block pages that you don't want to be included in them.

So why use this instead of the other hundreds(?) of sitemap plugins that's out are and which has thousands(?) of downloads? Well for one thing it's just an easy, fast and secure plugin that will just work for you, and it also makes the life pretty easy for search engines that wants to index your site!
